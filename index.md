## Introduction
Story Maps are a relatively new and unique way of telling stories by using maps, images and videos. Esri offers many different Story Map templates that can be utilized for a multitude of projects and purposes.

## *[Story Map Tour]*
The Story Map Tour allows you to link photos and videos with an interactive map. The most popular use for this kind of story map is to create guided walking tours for readers.

2. Locate the Story Map Tour and select **Build**
